export default function (str: string | number): str is number {
	// Although it doesn't check for decimals, it is not required here.

	//original code:
	//return typeof str === 'number' || /^\d+$/.test(str);
	/** Why this works:
	 *
	 *  1. Any sensical value that would pass str === 'number' would also
	 * 		 pass !isNaN(str), as all non-NaN numbers are typeof 'number'.
	 *  a. Granted, this assumes that str cannot be NaN, but in the contexts
	 * 		 where this function is used, it cannot be NaN.
	 *  2. The regex /^\d+$/ matches any string that contains only digits.
	 * 		 This is checking whether the string itself is numeric, something
	 * 		 isNaN accomplishes by casting the string to a number before checking.
	 * 	a. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/isNaN
	 */

	/** Why do we need this?
	 *  It's significantly faster than the original code. Regex matching is
	 *  slow, and this function is called many times for each operation.
	 * 	For parseEconItem, this resulted in 15% faster execution.
